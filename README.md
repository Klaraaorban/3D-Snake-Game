# 🐍 3D Snake Game with Ursina Engine 🕹️

Always wanted to create a Snake-Game, but the 2D version seemed too plain. So here is a 3D version!

## 🎮 Features
- **3D Snake Movement**: Navigate the snake in a 3D grid world.
- **Food Generation** 🍎: Collect food to increase the snake’s length and score.
- **Edge Wrap-around** 🔄: Snake wraps around the edges, so no walls to worry about!
- **Auto Exit**: Game automatically ends when the snake collides with itself.
- **Score Display** 🏆: Track your progress with an on-screen score counter.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repo.
2. Ensure Python and the `Ursina` package are installed.
3. Run the `3D_Snake.py` file.

```bash
pip install ursina
python 3D_Snake.py
```
- **Enjoy ;))**
